# GTK-Calculator
This is a calculator I've written using C and the GTK-4 library. It takes an infix expression, parses it into an RPN/postfix expression and evaluates it. It has the basic functions, and more can be added if needed.

# Dependencies
* Linux
* libgtk-4-dev
* Make
* gcc

# Desktop File
I have also added a desktop file here. You can paste it into ~/.local/share/applications/ if you want to select the app from your app selector.
